# 90 Days of Challenge - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

Welcome to the "90 Days of Challenge - Data Structures and Algorithms" project! This repository documents my journey over the next 90 days as I dive deep into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal of this challenge is to enhance my understanding of fundamental concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and strengthen my overall programming abilities.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this challenge is to:

- Master essential data structures and algorithms.
- Sharpen problem-solving skills through regular practice.
- Build a strong foundation for tackling complex programming challenges.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Each day's folder contains:

- **Problem Statement:** A description of the DSA problem I am tackling.
- **Solution:** My implementation of the solution in Python/Java/C++ (choose the language you prefer).
- **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:** Evaluation of the efficiency of my solution.

## Progress

I will update the progress regularly in the [Progress.md](Progress.md) file, summarizing the topics covered, challenges faced, and lessons learned each day.

## How to Use

Feel free to use this repository as a reference or join me in the challenge! Clone the repository, follow along, and share your progress.
